# Watercolor Clouds / [Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bBkBVnrg2g)

Inspired by [this article](http://www.tylerlhobbs.com/writings/watercolor), this is an attempt to create a watercolor effect by layering semi-transparent shapes with slight alterations each generation.

I would like to rewrite this project in [Processing](https://www.processing.org) which would make things a lot easier. If you follow along with the tutorial you should be able to follow the logic even if you choose to use Processing. Feel free to reach out to thebuffed@gmail.com if you have any questions.
